The problem statement is  RDA application is that it receives and manages many documents from various sources.​

The current approach involves manually going through project descriptions and searching for relevant documents. This manual process is time-consuming and inefficient, requiring DAs to dedicate significant time and effort to analyze each project individually.​

 With a large number of projects requiring impact analysis, the manual approach becomes even more  impractical. DAs may struggle to keep up with the volume of work, leading to delays in analysis and decision-making.​

​

The accuracy and effectiveness of the impact analysis are heavily dependent on the experience and expertise of the DA. Less experienced analysts may struggle to identify relevant information or interpret project descriptions accurately, leading to potential errors in analysis.​

​

 Searching for relevant information within documents can be challenging, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data. It will take a significant amount of time sifting through documents to extract relevant details, increasing the likelihood of overlooking important insights.​
